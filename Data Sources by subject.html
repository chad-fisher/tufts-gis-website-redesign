        <p>The US Census of Agriculture takes place every five years and reports agricultural data aggregated by county and
            state.</p>
        
        <p>We haven't tested out the 2007 Census of Agriculture query tools extensively yet for compatibility with GIS, but the
            general concept holds that you will get data by county in a spreadsheet or .CSV format and should then in principle
            be able to join that data with a county boundary GIS data set.</p>
        
        <p>The 2002 Census of Agriculture information is available for download into GIS formatted tables. Instructions:</p>
        
        <p>1. Go to <a href="http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2002/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2002
                Census of Agriculture Query by State and County site</a></p>
        
        <p>2. Select the data that you want and the geographical area you are interested in. Once you have made your selections,
            hit the get data tab.</p>
        
        <p>3. At the end of the table that results, there is an option to "Click here for a GIS version of this output." On the
            next screen you must choose download dbf, txt, or all GIS files. Getting the DBF file will provide a table that
            includes the State and County FIPS codes combined. This can be joined to US county boundary files (One source for
            the county boundary files with basic Agricultural Census data is at the National Atlas site - read the note below).

Many of these relate to specimens in natural history museums and herbaria around the world, or to living cultures of micro-organisms, but at least a third come from observations of wild organisms. Wherever possible these records include information about the locality where the organisms were found and are used to generate maps of the distribution of these occurrences. Counts of occurrence records are listed against the organism names to which they apply. For genera and taxa of higher ranks, these counts include only those occurrences which have been identified to the taxon concerned. For species these counts include all occurrences for the species and also for any included infraspecific taxa, as well as for any known synonyms."</p>

        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Accessing 2000 and 2010 Census Data</h6>
        <p>When using Census information in GIS, you need to have both <b>geographic boundary files (e.g., census tracts)</b> and <b>the census data (attribute tables)</b> that join to those boundary files.</p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">The Tabular Attribute Data</h6>
        <p>Please follow these instructions to download 2010 and 2000 data from the census: <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/gisclone/files/2013/11/Census-Tutorial_Downloading-and-Mapping-American-FactFinder2-Tract-Data2.pdf" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Census Tutorial: Downloading and Mapping American FactFinder Data</a>.</p>
        <p>Data available depend on the year. After 2000, estimates are collected and published depending on the how big the population of area is. Please see <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">American Community Survey</a> for estimate schedules. For the years 2000 and 1990, data typically come from either the 100% census (SF1 and SF2) or from the sample "long form" sent one out of every several households (SF3 and SF4). The 100% SF1 data has basic demographic information on population counts, age, gender, race, ethnicity, and household/family relationships. The sample SF3 data contains a wealth of more detailed information including income, employment, education, transportation to work, language, and ancestry.</p>

See the web site for details on how the SRTM and other data sources were processed, and for status of other areas and expected completion dates. If you are looking for DEMs for areas outside the US, this should be your first choice. If not available here, go to the CGIAR SRTM site (below)</li>

Note, if you have trouble identifying your area on the small CGIAR map, you can click on the Google Earth SRTM KML link further down the CIGIAR page to use Google Earth to locate your data more accurately. If you download GeoTiff format files (which work well in ArcGIS), make sure to follow the directions in <a href="http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SRTM_FAQ.asp" target="_blank">the SRTM FAQs page</a> regarding fixing the problem with cell values of -32768. These values should be set to NO DATA. The FAQ explains what equation to use (OUTGRID = setnull(SRTMDEM == -32768, SRTMDEM) - you can use this equation in the Spatial Analyst Raster Calculator. Replace OUTGRID with the name of your new fixed SRTM tile (e.g., fix4210), and substitute the name of your original SRTM file for the "SRTMDEM" in the equation. E.g., for an SRTM called z_42_10.TIF that I downloaded, I used the following function in the Raster Calculator: <br class="atl-forced-newline">fix4210 = setnull([GISDataSources:Z_42_10.TIF] == -32768, [GISDataSources:Z_42_10.TIF] This creates a new grid, fix4210, that has all values of -32768 set to No Data, and all other values set to whatever they were in the original SRTM DEM.</li>
            <p>Also, note that you can use the Mosaic to New Raster command under the Data Management - Raster Toolbox in ArcGIS 9 to mosaic multiple tiles to a single raster. While you're doing this, you should probably specify a projected coordinate system so that the other surface, hydro, etc. functions will work properly. |</p>

        <p>2001 land cover, impervious cover, and canopy cover data set produced by the MRLC Consortium of US federal agencies (EPA, USGS, US Forest Service, etc.). The 1992 landcover data set is complete for the entire US. Production of 2001 landcover, impervious cover, and canopy cover is underway - see Production Status link for a map of what stage each region is in. Note: although the production status may show an area complete, you may have to go to the FTP data download link to actually get the data. The Dynamic Map download choice does not seem to be updated regularly. Read the metadata to understand the attribute information. The data is a raster data set with 30 meter pixels.</p>

        <p>This is Professor David Maidment's web site at the Center for Research in Water Resources at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Maidment is a hydrologist and an international expert in the use of GIS in hydrologic analysis. Under his classes link, you can find his course web sites, all of which have exercises and data sets focusing on using water resource information in GIS.&nbsp; See especially the links for <em>GIS in Water Resources</em>. There are also videos of his lectures available. Note: the web site doesn't seem to work with Mozilla, so try it with Internet Explorer.</p>

        <p>From the NHD web site: "The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that contains information about surface water features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, springs and wells. Within the NHD, surface water features are combined to form "reaches," which provide the framework for linking water-related data to the NHD surface water drainage network. These linkages enable the analysis and display of these water-related data in upstream and downstream order.</p>

These data sets were created using the PRISM climate mapping system, developed by Dr. Christopher Daly, PRISM Group director. PRISM is unique in that it incorporates a spatial climate knowledge base that accounts for rain shadows, temperature inversions, coastal effects, and more in the climate mapping process."</p>
